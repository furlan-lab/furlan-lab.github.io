To build a robust transcriptional risk prediction model for pediatric AML, we perform RNA-sequencing on 1503 primary diagnostic samples. While a 17 gene leukemia stem cell signature (LSC17) is predictive in our aggregated pediatric study population, LSC17 is no longer predictive within established cytogenetic and molecular (cytomolecular) risk groups. Therefore, we identify distinct LSC signatures on the basis of AML cytomolecular subtypes (LSC47) that were more predictive than LSC17. Based on these findings, we build a robust relapse prediction model within a training cohort and then validate it within independent cohorts. Here, we show that LSC47 increases the predictive power of conventional risk stratification and that applying biomarkers in a manner that is informed by cytomolecular profiling outperforms a uniform biomarker approach.},

   abstract = {Some hematological malignancies such as multiple myeloma are inherently resistant to immune-mediated antitumor responses, the cause of which remains unknown. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) is the only curative immunotherapy for hematological malignancies due to profound graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effects, but relapse remains the major cause of death. We developed murine models of alloBMT where the hematological malignancy is either sensitive [acute myeloid leukemia (AML)] or resistant (myeloma) to GVT effects. We found that CD8+ T cell exhaustion in bone marrow was primarily alloantigen-driven, with expression of inhibitory ligands present on myeloma but not AML. Because of this tumor-independent exhaustion signature, immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in myeloma exacerbated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) without promoting GVT effects. Administration of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) depleted donor T cells with an exhausted phenotype and spared T cells displaying a stem-like memory phenotype with chromatin accessibility present in cytokine signaling genes, including the interleukin-18 (IL-18) receptor. Whereas ICI with anti-PD-1 or anti-TIM-3 remained ineffective after PT-Cy, administration of a decoy-resistant IL-18 (DR-18) strongly enhanced GVT effects in both myeloma and leukemia models, without exacerbation of GVHD. We thus defined mechanisms of resistance to T cell-mediated antitumor effects after alloBMT and described an immunotherapy approach targeting stem-like memory T cells to enhance antitumor immunity.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Propagation of Ewing sarcoma requires precise regulation of EWS::FLI1 transcriptional activity. Determining the mechanisms of fusion regulation will advance our understanding of tumor progression. Here we investigated whether HOXD13, a developmental transcription factor that promotes Ewing sarcoma metastatic phenotypes, influences EWS::FLI1 transcriptional activity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Existing tumor and cell line datasets were used to define EWS::FLI1 binding sites and transcriptional targets. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and CRISPR interference were employed to identify enhancers. CUT&RUN and RNA sequencing defined binding sites and transcriptional targets of HOXD13. Transcriptional states were investigated using bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data from cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and patient tumors. Mesenchymal phenotypes were assessed by gene set enrichment, flow cytometry, and migration assays. RESULTS: We found that EWS::FLI1 creates a de novo GGAA microsatellite enhancer in a developmentally conserved regulatory region of the HOXD locus. Knockdown of HOXD13 led to widespread changes in expression of developmental gene programs and EWS::FLI1 targets. HOXD13 binding was enriched at established EWS::FLI1 binding sites where it influenced expression of EWS::FLI1-activated genes. More strikingly, HOXD13 bound and activated EWS::FLI1-repressed genes, leading to adoption of mesenchymal and migratory cell states that are normally suppressed by the fusion. Single-cell analysis confirmed that direct transcriptional antagonism between HOXD13-mediated gene activation and EWS::FLI1-dependent gene repression defines the state of Ewing sarcoma cells along a mesenchymal axis. CONCLUSIONS: Ewing sarcoma tumors are comprised of tumor cells that exist along a mesenchymal transcriptional continuum. The identity of cells along this continuum is, in large part, determined by the competing activities of EWS::FLI1 and HOXD13. See related commentary by Weiss and Bailey, p. 4360.},

   abstract = {Regulatory T cells (Tregs) promote immune homeostasis by maintaining self-tolerance and regulating inflammatory responses. Under certain inflammatory conditions, Tregs can lose their lineage stability and function. Previous studies have reported that ex vivo exposure to retinoic acid (RA) enhances Treg function and stability. However, it is unknown how RA receptor signaling in Tregs influences these processes in vivo. Herein, we employed mouse models in which RA signaling is silenced by the expression of the dominant negative receptor (DN) RARα in all T cells. Despite the fact that DNRARα conventional T cells are hypofunctional, Tregs had increased CD25 expression, STAT5 pathway activation, mTORC1 signaling and supersuppressor function. Furthermore, DNRARα Tregs had increased inhibitory molecule expression, amino acid transporter expression, and metabolic fitness and decreased antiapoptotic proteins. Supersuppressor function was observed when wild-type mice were treated with a pharmacologic pan-RAR antagonist. Unexpectedly, Treg-specific expression of DNRARα resulted in distinct phenotypes, such that a single allele of DNRARα in Tregs heightened their suppressive function, and biallelic expression led to loss of suppression and autoimmunity. The loss of Treg function was not cell intrinsic, as Tregs that developed in a noninflammatory milieu in chimeric mice reconstituted with DNRARα and wild-type bone marrow maintained the enhanced suppressive capacity. Fate mapping suggested that maintaining Treg stability in an inflammatory milieu requires RA signaling. Our findings indicate that RA signaling acts as a rheostat to balance Treg function in inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions in a dose-dependent manner.},

Recent studies have also demonstrated that tumorigenicity of Ewing sarcoma requires precise regulation of the transcriptional activity of the EWS-FLI1 oncogenic driver. Here we show that the developmentally and anatomically restricted transcription factor HOXD13 is a direct target of EWS-FLI1. Transcriptomic and CUT&RUN studies revealed that HOXD13 binds active, fusion-bound enhancers, resulting in altered expression of EWS-FLI1-induced targets. More strikingly, HOXD13 was found to bind and activate cis-regulatory regions of genes that are normally repressed by EWS-FLI1. Single-cell sequencing demonstrated marked intra-tumoral heterogeneity of HOXD13 transcriptional activity and revealed that antagonism between HOXD13-mediated gene activation and EWS-FLI1-dependent gene repression confers a spectrum of transcriptional cell states along a mesenchymal axis. Thus, HOXD13 serves as an internal rheostat for EWS-FLI1 activity, providing a paradigm for tissue-specific transcription factors as critical partners in fusion-driven cancers.},

To assess if Notch’s effects are evolutionarily conserved and identify key mechanisms, we studied antibody-mediated DLL4 blockade in a non-human primate model similar to human allo-HCT. Short-term DLL4 blockade improved post-transplant survival with striking, durable protection from gastrointestinal GVHD, out of proportion to other disease sites. Unlike prior immunosuppressive strategies, anti-DLL4 interfered with a T-cell transcriptional program associated with intestinal infiltration. In cross-species investigations, Notch inhibition decreased surface abundance of the gut-homing integrin a4b7 in conventional T-cells via b1 competition for a4 binding, while preserving a4b7 in regulatory T-cells. Thereby, DLL4/Notch blockade decreased effector T-cell infiltration into the gut, with increased regulatory to conventional T-cell ratios early after allo-HCT. Our results identify a conserved, biologically unique and targetable role of DLL4/Notch signaling in GVHD.},

Although the adoptive transfer of expanded tTregs purified from umbilical cord blood ameliorates graft-versus-host disease in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for lymphohematopoietic malignancy, individual Treg products of 100 × 106 cells/kg are manufactured over an extended 19-day time period using a process that yields variable products and is both laborious and costly. These limitations could be overcome with the availability of ‘off the shelf’ Treg. Results: Previously, the authors reported a repetitive restimulation expansion protocol that maintains Treg phenotype (CD4+25++127-Foxp3+), potentially providing hundreds to thousands of patient infusions. However, repetitive stimulation of effector T cells induces a well-defined program of exhaustion that leads to reduced T-cell survival and function. Unexpectedly, the authors found that multiply stimulated human tTregs do not develop an exhaustion signature and instead maintain their Treg gene expression pattern. The authors also found that tTregs expanded with one or two rounds of stimulation and tTregs expanded with three or five rounds of stimulation preferentially express distinct subsets of a group of five transcription factors that lock in Treg Foxp3expression, Treg stability and suppressor function. Multiply restimulated Tregs also had increased transcripts characteristic of T follicular regulatory cells, a Treg subset. Discussion: These data demonstrate that repetitively expanded human tTregs have a Treg-locking transcription factor with stable FoxP3 and without the classical T-cell exhaustion gene expression profile—desirable properties that support the possibility of off-the-shelf Treg therapeutics.},

CBFA2T3-GLIS2 (C/G) fusion occurs exclusively in infants and is associated with highly aggressive disease1-4. Here we report that lentiviral transduction of C/G fusion is sufficient to induce malignant transformation of human cord blood hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (CB HSPCs) that fully recapitulates C/G AML. Engineered CB HSPCs co-cultured with endothelial cells undergo complete malignant transformation with identical molecular, morphologic, phenotypic and disease characteristics observed in primary C/G AML. Interrogating the transcriptome of engineered cells identified a library of C/G fusion-specific targets that are candidates for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. We developed CAR-T cells directed against one of the targets, FOLR1, and demonstrated the pre-clinical efficacy against C/G AML while sparing normal hematopoiesis. Our findings underscore the role of the endothelial niche in promoting leukemic transformation of C/G-transduced CB HSPCs. Moreover, this work has broad implications for studies of leukemogenesis applicable to a variety of oncogenic fusion-driven pediatric leukemias, providing a robust and tractable model system to characterize the molecular mechanisms of leukemogenesis and identify biomarkers for disease diagnosis and targets for therapy.},

   abstract = {Patients with acute leukemia who are unable to achieve complete remission prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) have dismal outcomes, with relapse rates well in excess of 60%. Haplo-identical SCT (haplo-SCT) may allow enhanced graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects by virtue of HLA class I/II donor-host disparities, but it typically requires intensive immunosuppression with posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) to prevent lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Here, we demonstrate in preclinical models that glucocorticoid administration from days –1 to +5 inhibits alloantigen presentation by professional recipient antigen presenting cells in the gastrointestinal tract and prevents donor T cell priming and subsequent expansion therein. In contrast, direct glucocorticoid signaling of donor T cells promotes chemokine and integrin signatures permissive of preferential circulation and migration into the BM, promoting donor T cell residency. This results in significant reductions in GVHD while promoting potent GVL effects; relapse in recipients receiving glucocorticoids, vehicle, or PT-Cy was 12%, 56%, and 100%, respectively. Intriguingly, patients with acute myeloid leukemia not in remission who received unmanipulated haplo-SCT and peritransplant glucocorticoids also had an unexpectedly low relapse rate at 1 year (32%; 95% CI, 18%–47%) with high overall survival at 3 years (58%; 95% CI, 38%–74%).

There are no approved agents for AGVHD prevention, underscoring the critical unmet need for novel therapeutics. ABA2 was a phase II trial to rigorously assess safety, efficacy, and immunologic effects of adding T-cell costimulation blockade with abatacept to calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)/methotrexate (MTX)-based GVHD prophylaxis, to test whether abatacept could decrease AGVHD. METHODS ABA2 enrolled adults and children with hematologic malignancies under two strata: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled stratum (8/8-HLA-matched URD), comparing CNI/MTX plus abatacept with CNI/MTX plus placebo, and a single-arm stratum (7/8-HLA-mismatched URD) comparing CNI/MTX plus abatacept versus CNI/MTX CIBMTR controls. The primary end point was day +100 grade 3-4 AGVHD, with day +180 severe-AGVHD-free-survival (SGFS) a key secondary end point. Sample sizes were calculated using a higher type-1 error (0.2) as recommended for phase II trials, and were based on predicting that abatacept would reduce grade 3-4 AGVHD from 20% to 10% (8/8s) and 30% to 10% (7/8s). ABA2 enrolled 142 recipients (8/8s, median follow-up = 716 days) and 43 recipients (7/8s, median follow-up = 708 days). RESULTS In 8/8s, grade 3-4 AGVHD was 6.8% (abatacept) versus 14.8% (placebo) (P = .13, hazard ratio = 0.45). SGFS was 93.2% (CNI/MTX plus abatacept) versus 82% (CNI/MTX plus placebo, P = .05). In the smaller 7/8 cohort, grade 3-4 AGVHD was 2.3% (CNI/MTX plus abatacept, intention-to-treat population), which compared favorably with a nonrandomized matched cohort of CNI/MTX (30.2%, P < .001), and the SGFS was better (97.7% v 58.7%, P < .001). Immunologic analysis revealed control of T-cell activation in abatacept-treated patients. CONCLUSION Adding abatacept to URD HCT was safe, reduced AGVHD, and improved SGFS. These results suggest that abatacept may substantially improve AGVHD-related transplant outcomes, with a particularly beneficial impact on HLA-mismatched HCT.},

   abstract = {The nuclear receptor (NR) subclass, retinoid X receptors (RXRs), exert immunomodulatory functions that control inflammation and metabolism via homodimers and heterodimers, with several other NRs, including retinoic acid receptors. IRX4204 is a novel, highly specific RXR agonist in clinical trials that potently and selectively activates RXR homodimers, but not heterodimers. In this study, in vivo IRX4204 compared favorably with FK506 in abrogating acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which was associated with inhibiting allogeneic donor T-cell proliferation, reducing T-helper 1 differentiation, and promoting regulatory T-cell (Treg) generation. Recipient IRX4204 treatment reduced intestinal injury and decreased IFN-γ and TNF-α serum levels. Transcriptional analysis of donor T cells isolated from intestines of GVHD mice treated with IRX4204 revealed significant decreases in transcripts regulating proinflammatory pathways. In vitro, inducible Treg differentiation from naive CD4+ T cells was enhanced by IRX4204. In vivo, IRX4204 increased the conversion of donor Foxp3− T cells into peripheral Foxp3+ Tregs in GVHD mice. Using Foxp3 lineage-tracer mice in which both the origin and current FoxP3 expression of Tregs can be tracked, we demonstrated that IRX4204 supports Treg stability. Despite favoring Tregs and reducing Th1 differentiation, IRX4204-treated recipients maintained graft-versus-leukemia responses against both leukemia and lymphoma cells. Notably, IRX4204 reduced in vitro human T-cell proliferation and enhanced Treg generation in mixed lymphocyte reaction cultures. Collectively, these beneficial effects indicate that targeting RXRs with IRX4204 could be a novel approach to preventing acute GVHD in the clinic. Key Points: • A novel RXR agonist attenuates acute GVHD, while retaining graft-versus-leukemia responses. • The RXR agonist enhances Treg generation and stabilizes Foxp3, even in a highly inflammatory environment.},

   abstract = {One of the central challenges in the field of allo-immunity is deciphering the mechanisms driving T cells to infiltrate and subsequently occupy target organs to cause disease. The act of CD8-dominated T cell infiltration is critical to acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), wherein donor T cells become activated, tissue-infiltrating and highly cytotoxic, causing wide-spread tissue damage after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HCT). However, in human and non-human primate studies, deconvolving the transcriptional programs of newly recruited relative to resident memory T cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has remained a challenge. In this study, we combined the novel technique of Serial Intravascular Staining (SIVS) with single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) to enable detailed dissection of the tightly connected processes by which T cells first infiltrate tissues and then establish a pathogenic tissue residency program after allo-HCT in non-human primates. Our results have enabled the creation of a spatiotemporal map of the transcriptional drivers of CD8 T cell infiltration into the primary aGVHD target-organ, the GI tract. We identify the large and small intestines as the only two sites demonstrating allo-specific, rather than lymphdepletiondriven T cell infiltration. The donor CD8 T cells that infiltrate the GI tract demonstrate a highly activated, cytotoxic phenotype while simultaneously rapidly developing canonical tissue-resident memory (TRM) protein expression and transcriptional signatures, driven by IL-15/IL-21 signaling. Moreover, by combining SIVS and transcriptomic analysis, we have been able to work backwards from this pathogenic TRM programing, and, for the first time, identify a cluster of genes directly associated with tissue invasiveness, prominently including specific chemokines and adhesion molecules and their receptors, as well as a central cytoskeletal transcriptional node. The clinical relevance of this new tissue invasion signature was validated by its ability to discriminate the CD8 T cell transcriptome of patients with GI aGVHD. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms controlling tissue infiltration and pathogenic CD8 TRM transcriptional programing, uncovering critical transitions in allo-immune tissue invasion and destruction.

   abstract = {Background Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a uniformly fatal CNS tumor diagnosed in 300 American children per year. Radiation is the only effective treatment and extends overall survival to a median of 11 months. Due to its location in the brainstem, DIPG cannot be surgically resected. Immunotherapy has the ability to target tumor cells specifically; however, little is known about the tumor microenvironment in DIPGs. We sought to characterize infiltrating immune cells and immunosuppressive factor expression in pediatric low- and high-grade gliomas and DIPG. Methods Tumor microarrays were stained for infiltrating immune cells. RNA was isolated from snap-frozen tumor tissue and Nanostring analysis performed. DIPG and glioblastoma cells were co-cultured with healthy donor macrophages, T cells, or natural killer (NK) cells, and flow cytometry and cytotoxicity assays performed to characterize the phenotype and function, respectively, of the immune cells. Results DIPG tumors do not have increased macrophage or T-cell infiltration relative to nontumor control, nor do they overexpress immunosuppressive factors such as programmed death ligand 1 and/or transforming growth factor β1. H3.3-K27M DIPG cells do not repolarize macrophages, but are not effectively targeted by activated allogeneic T cells. NK cells lysed all DIPG cultures. Conclusions DIPG tumors have neither a highly immunosuppressive nor inflammatory microenvironment. Therefore, major considerations for the development of immunotherapy will be the recruitment, activation, and retention of tumor-specific effector immune cells.},

We infect rhesus macaques with SHIV-1157ipd3N4, suppress them with cART, then transplant them using MHC-haploidentical allogeneic donors during continuous cART. Transplant results in ~100% myeloid donor chimerism, and up to 100% T-cell chimerism. Between 9 and 47 days post-transplant, terminal analysis shows that while cell-associated SHIV DNA levels are reduced in the blood and in lymphoid organs post-transplant, the SHIV reservoir persists in multiple organs, including the brain. Sorting of donor-vs.-recipient cells reveals that this reservoir resides in recipient cells. Moreover, tetramer analysis indicates a lack of virus-specific donor immunity post-transplant during continuous cART. These results suggest that early post-transplant, allo-HCT is insufficient for recipient reservoir eradication despite high-level donor chimerism and GVHD.},

CD28-CD80/86 costimulation blockade represents a promising strategy, but targeting CD80/CD86 with CTLA4-Ig may be associated with undesired blockade of coinhibitory pathways. In contrast, targeted blockade of CD28 exclusively inhibits T cell costimulation and may more potently prevent GVHD. Here, we investigated FR104, an antagonistic CD28-specific pegylated-Fab', in the nonhuman primate (NHP) GVHD model and completed a multiparameter interrogation comparing it with CTLA4-Ig, with and without sirolimus, including clinical, histopathologic, flow cytometric, and transcriptomic analyses. We document that FR104 monoprophylaxis and combined prophylaxis with FR104/sirolimus led to enhanced control of effector T cell proliferation and activation compared with the use of CTLA4-Ig or CTLA4-Ig/sirolimus. Importantly, FR104/sirolimus did not lead to a beneficial impact on Treg reconstitution or homeostasis, consistent with control of conventional T cell activation and IL-2 production needed to support Tregs. While FR104/sirolimus had a salutary effect on GVHD-free survival, overall survival was not improved, due to death in the absence of GVHD in several FR104/sirolimus recipients in the setting of sepsis and a paralyzed INF-γ response. These results therefore suggest that effectively deploying CD28 in the clinic will require close scrutiny of both the benefits and risks of extensively abrogating conventional T cell activation after transplant.},

Life-threatening complications include cytokine release syndrome and neurologic adverse events, the exact etiologies of which are unclear. To elucidate the underlying toxicity mechanisms and test potentially safer CAR T cells, we developed a mouse model in which human CD19 (hCD19)-specific mouse CAR T cells were adoptively transferred into mice whose normal B cells express a hCD19 transgene at hemizygous levels. Compared to homozygous hCD19 transgenic mice that have ∼75% fewer circulating B cells, hemizygous mice had hCD19 frequencies and antigen density more closely simulating human B cells. Hemizygous mice given a lethal dose of hCD19 transgene-expressing lymphoma cells and treated with CAR T cells had undetectable tumor levels. Recipients experienced B cell aplasia and antigen- and dose-dependent acute toxicities mirroring patient complications. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon γ (IFN-γ), and inflammatory pathway transcripts were enriched in affected tissues. As in patients, antibody-mediated neutralization of IL-6 (and IFN-γ) blunted toxicity. Apparent behavioral abnormalities associated with decreased microglial cells point to CAR-T-cell-induced neurotoxicity. This model will prove useful in testing strategies designed to improve hCD19-specific CAR T cell safety. Pennell et al. describe a human CD19 transgenic mouse model that mirrors the tumor efficacy and morbidities associated with CAR T cell therapy for human B cell malignancies. This model should allow approaches designed to reduce toxicity while preserving anti-tumor effects to be explored prior to testing in the clinic.},

A major barrier to developing therapeutics to prevent CAR T cell–mediated neurotoxicity is the lack of clinically relevant models. Accordingly, we developed a rhesus macaque (RM) model of neurotoxicity via adoptive transfer of autologous CD20-specifi c CAR T cells. Following cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion, CD20 CAR T cells expand to 272 to 4,450 cells/μL after 7 to 8 days and elicit CRS and neurotoxicity.

During neurotoxicity, both CD20 CAR and non-CAR T cells accumulate in the CSF and in the brain parenchyma. This RM model demonstrates that CAR T cell–mediated neurotoxicity is associated with proinfl ammatory CSF cytokines and a pan–T cell encephalitis.

   abstract = {A critical question facing the field of transplantation is how to control effector T cell (Teff) activation while preserving regulatory T cell (Treg) function. Standard calcineurin inhibitor-based strategies can partially control Teffs, but breakthrough activation still occurs, and these agents are antagonistic to Treg function. Conversely, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition with sirolimus is more Treg-compatible but is inadequate to fully control Teff activation. In contrast, blockade of OX40L signaling has the capacity to partially control Teff activation despite maintaining Treg function. We used the nonhuman primate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) model to probe the efficacy of combinatorial immunomodulation with sirolimus and the OX40L-blocking antibody KY1005. Our results demonstrate significant biologic activity of KY1005 alone (prolonging median GVHD-free survival from 8 to 19.5 days), as well as marked, synergistic control of GVHD with KY1005 + sirolimus (median survival time, >100 days; P < 0.01 compared to all other regimens), which was associated with potent control of both TH/TC1 (T helper cell 1/cytotoxic T cell 1) and TH/TC17 activation. Combined administration also maintained Treg reconstitution [resulting in an enhanced Treg/Teff ratio (40% over baseline) in the KY1005/sirolimus cohort compared to a 2.9-fold decrease in the unprophylaxed GVHD cohort]. This unique immunologic signature resulted in transplant recipients that were able to control GVHD for the length of analysis and to down-regulate donor/ recipient alloreactivity despite maintaining anti-third-party responses. These data indicate that combined OX40L blockade and sirolimus represents a promising strategy to induce immune balance after transplant and is an important candidate regimen for clinical translation.},

We have previously shown that in MHC-matched nonhuman primates (NHPs), a busulfan plus combined belatacept and anti-CD154-based regimen could induce long-lived myeloid chimerism, but without T cell chimerism. In that setting, donor chimerism was eventually rejected, and tolerance to skin allografts was not achieved. Here, we describe an adaptation of this strategy, with the addition of low-dose total body irradiation to our conditioning regimen. This strategy has successfully induced multilineage hematopoietic chimerism in MHC-matched transplants that was stable for as long as 24 months posttransplant, the entire length of analysis. High-level T cell chimerism was achieved and associated with significant donor-specific prolongation of skin graft acceptance. However, we also observed significant infectious toxicities, prominently including cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation and end-organ disease in the setting of functional defects in anti-CMV T cell immunity. These results underscore the significant benefits that multilineage chimerism-induction approaches may represent to transplant patients as well as the inherent risks, and they emphasize the precision with which a clinically successful regimen will need to be formulated and then validated in NHP models.},

   abstract = {Conventional methods for profiling the molecular content of biological samples fail to resolve heterogeneity that is present at the level of single cells. In the past few years, single cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful strategy for overcoming this challenge. However, its adoption has been limited by a paucity of methods that are at once simple to implement and cost effective to scale massively. Here, we describe a combinatorial indexing strategy to profile the transcriptomes of large numbers of single cells or single nuclei without requiring the physical isolation of each cell (Single cell Combinatorial Indexing RNA-seq or sci-RNA-seq). We show that sci-RNA-seq can be used to efficiently profile the transcriptomes of tens-of-thousands of single cells per experiment, and demonstrate that we can stratify cell types from these data. Key advantages of sci-RNA-seq over contemporary alternatives such as droplet-based single cell RNA-seq include sublinear cost scaling, a reliance on widely available reagents and equipment, the ability to concurrently process many samples within a single workflow, compatibility with methanol fixation of cells, cell capture based on DNA content rather than cell size, and the flexibility to profile either cells or nuclei. As a demonstration of sci-RNA-seq, we profile the transcriptomes of 42,035 single cells from C. elegans at the L2 stage, effectively 50-fold “shotgun cellular coverage” of the somatic cell composition of this organism at this stage. We identify 27 distinct cell types, including rare cell types such as the two distal tip cells of the developing gonad, estimate consensus expression profiles and define cell-type specific and selective genes. Given that C. elegans is the only organism with a fully mapped cellular lineage, these data represent a rich resource for future methods aimed at defining cell types and states. They will advance our understanding of developmental biology, and constitute a major step towards a comprehensive, single-cell molecular atlas of a whole animal.},

   abstract = {One of the central challenges of transplantation is the development of alloreactivity despite the use of multiagent immunoprophylaxis. Effective control of this immune suppression-resistant T-cell activation represents one of the key unmet needs in the fields of both solid-organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). To address this unmet need, we have used a highly translational nonhuman primate (NHP) model to interrogate the transcriptional signature of T cells during breakthrough acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that occurs in the setting of clinically relevant immune suppression and compared this to the hyperacute GVHD, which develops in unprophylaxed or suboptimally prophylaxed transplant recipients. Our results demonstrate the complex character of the alloreactivity that develops during ongoing immunoprophylaxis and identify 3 key transcriptional hallmarks of breakthrough acute GVHD that are not observed in hyperacute GVHD: (1) T-cell persistence rather than proliferation, (2) evidence for highly inflammatory transcriptional programming, and (3) skewing toward a T helper (Th)/T cytotoxic (Tc)17 transcriptional program. Importantly, the gene coexpression profiles from human HCT recipients who developed GVHD while on immunosuppressive prophylactic agents recapitulated the patterns observed in NHP, and demonstrated an evolution toward a more inflammatory signature as time posttransplant progressed. These results strongly implicate the evolution of both inflammatory and interleukin 17-based immune pathogenesis in GVHD, and provide the first map of this evolving process in primates in the setting of clinically relevant immunomodulation. This map represents a novel transcriptomic resource for further systems-based efforts to study the breakthrough alloresponse that occurs posttransplant despite immunoprophylaxis and to develop evidence-based strategies for effective treatment of this disease.},

   abstract = {Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) interaction with PD-1 induces T cell exhaustion and is a therapeutic target to enhance immune responses against cancer and chronic infections. In murine bone marrow transplant models, PD-L1 expression on host target tissues reduces the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). PD-L1 is also expressed on T cells; however, it is unclear whether PD-L1 on this population influences immune function. Here, we examined the effects of PD-L1 modulation of T cell function in GVHD. In patients with severe GVHD, PD-L1 expression was increased on donor T cells. Compared with mice that received WT T cells, GVHD was reduced in animals that received T cells from Pdl1-/- donors. PD-L1-deficient T cells had reduced expression of gut homing receptors, diminished production of inflammatory cytokines, and enhanced rates of apoptosis. Moreover, multiple bioenergetic pathways, including aerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid metabolism, were also reduced in T cells lacking PD-L1. Finally, the reduction of acute GVHD lethality in mice that received Pdl1-/- donor cells did not affect graft-versus-leukemia responses. These data demonstrate that PD-L1 selectively enhances T cell-mediated immune responses, suggesting a context-dependent function of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, and suggest selective inhibition of PD-L1 on donor T cells as a potential strategy to prevent or ameliorate GVHD.},

   abstract = {Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the most common complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). However, our understanding of the molecular pathways that cause this disease remains incomplete, leading to inadequate treatment strategies. To address this, we measured the gene expression profile of nonhuman primate (NHP) T cells during acute GVHD. Utilizing microarray technology, we measured the expression profiles of CD3+ T cells from five cohorts: allogeneic transplant recipients receiving (i) no immunoprophylaxis (No Rx), (ii) sirolimus monotherapy (Siro), (iii) tacrolimus-methotrexate (Tac-Mtx), as well as (iv) autologous transplant recipients (Auto) and (v) healthy controls (HC). This comparison allowed us to identify transcriptomic signatures specific for alloreactive T cells and determine the impact of both mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) and calcineurin inhibition on GVHD. We found that the transcriptional profile of unprophylaxed GVHD was characterized by significant perturbation of pathways regulating T cell proliferation, effector function, and cytokine synthesis. Within these pathways, we discovered potentially druggable targets not previously implicated in GVHD, prominently including aurora kinase A (AURKA). Utilizing a murine GVHD model, we demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of AURKA could improve survival. Moreover, we found enrichment of AURKA transcripts both in allo-proliferating T cells and in sorted T cells from patients with clinical GVHD. These data provide a comprehensive elucidation of the T cell transcriptome in primate acute GVHD and suggest that AURKA should be considered a target for preventing GVHD, which, given the many available AURKA inhibitors in clinical development, could be quickly deployed for the prevention of GVHD.},

   abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs) function as professional antigen presenting cells and are critical for linking innate immune responses to the induction of adaptive immunity. Many current cancer DC vaccine strategies rely on differentiating DCs, feeding them tumor antigens ex vivo, and infusing them into patients. Importantly, this strategy relies on prior knowledge of suitable tumor-specific antigens to prime an effective anti-tumor response. DCs express a variety of receptors specific for the Fc region of immunoglobulins, and antigen uptake via Fc receptors is highly efficient and facilitates antigen presentation to T cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that expression of the mouse IgG1 Fc region on the surface of tumors would enhance tumor cell uptake by DCs and other myeloid cells and promote the induction of anti-tumor T cell responses. To test this, we engineered a murine lymphoma cell line expressing surface IgG1 Fc and discovered that such tumor cells were taken up rapidly by DCs, leading to enhanced cross-presentation of tumor-derived antigen to CD8+ T cells. IgG1-Fc tumors failed to grow in vivo and prophylactic vaccination of mice with IgG1-Fc tumors resulted in rejection of unmanipulated tumor cells. Furthermore, IgG1-Fc tumor cells were able to slow the growth of an unmanipulated primary tumor when used as a therapeutic tumor vaccine. Our data demonstrate that engagement of Fc receptors by tumors expressing the Fc region of IgG1 is a viable strategy to induce efficient and protective anti-tumor CD8+ T cell responses without prior knowledge of tumor-specific antigens. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.},

Here, we have found that these marked effects were significantly less pronounced in children, both in terms of the skewed CCR7/CD45RA expression profile as well as the increased perforin expression. Similar to adults, HIV-specific CD8 cells in children were largely CD27+ CD45RA- and lacked perforin. However, one pediatric subject with late-stage infection displayed robust expansion of Gag 77-85-specific CD8 T cells which were perforin+ and lytic, but lacked expression of CD27 and IFNγ. Our data indicate that the T cell effector maturation induced by HIV-1 infection is markedly weaker in children as compared to adults. The data also suggest, however, that the perforin-deficient state of HIV-specific CD8 T cells in children may be reversible. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Objectives: In HIV infection, activated monocytes are enriched in blood and in the perivascular area of the brain, especially in patients with HIV-associated dementia. Although clinical brain disease is uncommon during combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), autopsy series indicate that HIV-infected brain tissue can contain high numbers of monocytes/macrophages despite ART. Design: We assessed activated monocytes in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 76 living patients on and off ART. Plasma lipids were measured because they have been associated with monocyte activation and ART. Methods: A novel quantitative six-color flow cytometric approach was used to identify monocytes in blood and CSF and to evaluate monocyte activation status. Results: The mean percentage and number of activated CD16 monocytes in CSF was highest in individuals on combination ART, especially in those receiving protease inhibitors (PI). CSF viral load was also associated with higher monocyte activation in CSF. The mean calculated low density lipoprotein (LDL)-, oxidized LDL- and total cholesterol in plasma were highest in patients receiving PI. Conclusions: Activated monocytes are enriched in the CSF of persons living with HIV-1 and receiving ART. This finding is consistent with previously reported autopsy series. The mechanisms and long-term clinical consequences of persistent monocyte activation require further study. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

During STI, CD4+ T-cell percentage remained relatively stable in 4 of 8 subjects. The remaining 4 STI subjects had significant rapid decline in CD4+ T-cell percentage during STI, followed by return to pre-STI baseline while on HAART. Changes in overall CD4+ T-cell percentage corresponded with fluctuations in the CD45RA+CCR7+ naive and CD45RA-CCR7+ central memory subsets. Subjects with variable CD4+ T-cell percentages tended to have higher pre-HAART plasma HIV-1 RNA setpoints and experienced higher levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA rebound during STI.

   abstract = {The immunology of vertical HIV transmission differs from that of adult infection in that the immune system of the infant is not fully matured, and the factors that influence the functionality of CD8+ T cell responses against HIV in children remain largely undefined. We have investigated CD8+ T cell responses in 65 pediatric subjects with vertically acquired HIV-1 infection. Vigorous, broad, and Ag dose-driven CD8+ T cell responses against HIV Ags were frequently observed in children who were older than 3 years of age and maintained CD4+ T cell counts >400 cells/μl. In contrast, younger age or a CD4+ T cell count <400 cells/μl was associated with poor CD8+ T cell responses and high HIV loads. Furthermore, subjects with a severely depleted and phenotypically altered CD4+ T cell compartment had circulating Gag-specific CD8+ T cells with impaired IFN-γ production. When viral load was not suppressed by antiviral treatment, subjects that fell below the putative age and CD4+ T cell count thresholds had significantly reduced CD8+ T cell responses and significantly higher viral loads. Thus, the data suggest that fully effective HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses take years to develop despite an abundance of Ag in early life, and responses are further severely impaired, independent of age, in children who have a depleted or skewed CD4+ T cell compartment. The results are discussed in relation to differences between the neonatal and adult immune systems in the ability to respond to HIV infection.},

The fluorometric assessment of T lymphocyte antigen specific lysis (FATAL) assay employs dual staining (PKH-26 and CFSE) to identify and evaluate the target population. We found that the PKH-26/CFSE combination efficiently labeled target cells. Evaluation of the spontaneous leakage from dye labeled target cells was forty fold lower than the spontaneous leakage seen with the 51Cr release assay. The FATAL assay permitted a more accurate assessment of the effector: target ratio, and detected low levels of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) mediated lysis. There was a strong correlation between the 51Cr release and FATAL assays, when performed in parallel with identical effector and target cells (r2=0.998, P=<0.0001). This novel method of detecting cytolysis represents a qualitative and quantitative improvement over standard 51Cr release analysis.
